Blender exporter - storing camera, point light, sphere, cube and plane details in a JSON file

Camera space transforms - C++ camera class with methods to: read the exported JSON file and store camera information, method to convert pixel coordinates to a ray (with Ray class) in world coordinates

Image read and write - C++ image class with a constructor that takes a file name, methods to read and modify pixel  values of the image and a method that writes the image to a chosen file

Ray intersection - implemented ray intersection checker for each shape type, ensuring to transform the ray according to the shape's transformation and editing a hit structure object to include the intersection point and its distance along the ray.

Acceleration - implemented a bounding volume hierarchy structure using axis-aligned bounded boxes for each shape to speed up the ray-tracing processes
